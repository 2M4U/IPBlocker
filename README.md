# IPBlocker
Block majority of IOT Scanners/Crawlers and more from logging your Webserver/Server IP Address

#### Purpose:
This script prevents such as big companies like: [ZoomEye](https://zoomeye.org),[Shodan](https://shodan.io) being able to expose your IP Address, Open Ports, and much more to the world of what we know as of today as "Hackers", or to some people "Skids with zero knowledge".

I, 2M4U and a few fellow friends of mine have spent our time researching such websites with the intentions of Security Research, and Educational Purposes. 
We have produced this blocker script which works effiecently against such "Scanner" websites like the aforementioned ones.

#### Why?
As a person who regularly uses such websites like ZoomEye & Shodan to find vulnerable webservers and more, to [pentest](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/penetration-testing) their infrastructures.
I have been able to gain access to some big company websites that have been blinded simply due to their mistakes of their infrastructures being so vulnerable.

*Note: When pentesting, please always ask permission from the company/person's infrastructure beforehand, always ensure they give you LEGALIZED Permission in WRITING and have signed the docuement. A Signed Written Permission is always handy to have incase something goes wrong and you are not held responsible for the actions taken.*
